								<h4>I. What goals have I achieved:</h4>
								<font size="2">1. Determine the average mileage of BMW cars. </br>
								2. Compare the average MPG of BMW cars with different transmission types: automatic and manual. </br>
								3. Contrast other cars based on their average MPG and compare them to BMW cars. </br>
								4. Calculate the count of BMW cars in three price categories: under $10,000, between $10,000 and  $20,000, and over $20,000.  </br>
								5. Identify the highest-priced cars that have been sold. </br>
								6. Identify the lowest-priced cars that have been sold.  </br>
								7. Create a treemap to visualize the popularity of sold car models. </br>
								8. Analyze trends in the usage of different transmission types over the years.</font> </br></br>
								<h4>II. Data Cleaning: </h4> 
								<font size="2">1. Successfully loaded the dataset into Microsoft SQL Server. </br>
								2. Ensured the correct data types for each column in the data tables. </br>
								3. Conducted a thorough check for missing values and removed all NULL values.</font> </br></br>

<h4>V. Conclusions: </h4>
<font size="2" color="white">Our analysis reveals that BMW cars, on average, have a mileage of 25,496 miles.</br>
When examining BMW's fuel economy, we found that BMW cars equipped with automatic transmissions have an average fuel efficiency of 61 MPG, while those with manual transmissions average 58 MPG.</br></br>
Among all the car brands included in our study, BMW holds the third position in terms of average fuel economy. Notably, every brand in our dataset boasts a fuel economy exceeding 50 MPG. Ford takes the top spot in this regard, with Audi rounding out the list in the last position.</br>
The Vauxhall Astra holds the distinction of being the most affordable car in our dataset, selling for a mere £450. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Mercedes G Class stands out as the most expensive car sold, commanding a price of £159,999.</br>
The Ford Fiesta emerges as the most popular selling car model, with a staggering 6,557 units sold. The Volkswagen Golf follows closely behind, with 4,863 units finding buyers.</br></br>
Manual transmission cars take the lead in popularity, with the highest sales recorded in 2017 at 12,447 units. In contrast, automatic transmission cars do not enjoy the same level of popularity, peaking in sales in 2019 with 6,136 units sold.</br>
